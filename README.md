While much has been documented about inequitable vaccine distribution in Chicago, less has been said about the vaccine rollout at the county level, particularly in the suburbs next to the city which are predominantly communities of color.

Using Cicero as a case study, as well as other predominantly Black and brown suburbs of Cook County, South Side Weekly and Cicero Independiente team up to report on the systemic barriers faced by a growing suburban Latinx and Black community. We highlight areas for improvement from the perspective of community residents, social service experts, and government officials.
