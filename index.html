				While much has been documented about inequitable vaccine distribution in
				Chicago, less has been said about the vaccine rollout at the county level,
				particularly in the suburbs next to the city which are predominantly
				communities of color.
			</p>
			<p>
				Using Cicero as a case study, as well as other
				predominantly Black and brown suburbs of Cook County, South Side Weekly
				and Cicero Independiente team up to report on the systemic barriers
				faced by a growing suburban Latinx and Black community. We highlight
				areas for improvement from the perspective of community residents,
				social service experts, and government officials.

									As of May 2, 34 percent of all suburban Cook County residents
									had completed their COVID-19 vaccine series.
								</p>
						</div>
						<div class='step' data-index='1'>
							<p>
								But vaccine rates vary widely across municipalities: from
								<span style="color:#4d9221">74 percent in Barrington</span>, a
								wealthy northern suburb, to
								<span style="color:#c51b7d">9 percent in Dixmoor</span>, a largely
								Black and brown suburb just south of Chicago.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class='step' data-index='2'>
							<p>
								In fact, vaccination rates in several <span style="color:#c51b7d">
								predominately Black and brown suburbs</span> just south and west
								of Chicago are lower than rates in wealthier, whiter suburbs.
